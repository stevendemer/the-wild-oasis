## About the project

I wanted to put to the test everything i have learned so far in React and web development, and decided to go for a project
that combines a plethora of libraries. For the styling i used ShadCN/UI with Tailwindcss, Supabase for storage and authentication, React Query for server state management and Zustand for global state management. For the dashboard, i used the Recharts library.
